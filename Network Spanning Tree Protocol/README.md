# Computer-Network-Spanning-Tree-Protocol

Created a distributed version of the Spanning Tree Protocol that can be run on an arbitrary layer 2 topology.
Simulated the communications between switches until they converge on a single solution, and then output the final spanning tree. 
The spanning tree protocol can be used for any layer 2 network topology
